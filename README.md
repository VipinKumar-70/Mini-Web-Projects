# Mini-web-projects

Welcome to the Mini-Web-Projects repository!
This repository contains mini web projects that I have created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.The purpose of this repository is to provide useful project with source code for begninners.

All the projects source code are free and will always remain so.

## Topic to learn before building project:

1. **HTML**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It defines the structure of content on a web page by using a system of tags and attributes, which are interpreted by web browsers to render text, images, multimedia, and interactive elements to users.

2. **CSS**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements are displayed on a web page, including their layout, colors, fonts, and sizes. CSS enables web designers and developers to separate the structure and content of a web page from its visual presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the appearance of multiple web pages at once. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, designers can create visually appealing and responsive layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It was originally developed to run in web browsers, allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and communicate asynchronously with servers using AJAX. JavaScript is versatile, supporting both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It has evolved significantly with the introduction of ECMAScript standards, enhancing capabilities such as modern syntax features, modules, and asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await. JavaScript is now widely used not only for web development but also for server-side development (Node.js), mobile app development, and even desktop applications.

## Projects Included

### Random Quotes Generator

This is a basic application that shows how to use an API to fetch data from a server. You will learn how the fetch() method works with APIs. In this project, data is fetched from the API and stored in JSON format. The API provides five random quotes each time you click the "Show Quotes" button. You can also navigate among these five quotes using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

### Javascript TO-DO List

This project helps you create a simple to-do list application using JavaScript. You will learn how to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. This project is an excellent way to understand how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript.

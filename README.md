## Topic to learn before building project:

### 1. **HTML**: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It defines the structure of content on a web page by using a system of tags and attributes, which are interpreted by web browsers to render text, images, multimedia, and interactive elements to users.

### 2. **CSS**: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements are displayed on a web page, including their layout, colors, fonts, and sizes. CSS enables web designers and developers to separate the structure and content of a web page from its visual presentation, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the appearance of multiple web pages at once. By applying CSS rules to HTML elements, designers can create visually appealing and responsive layouts that adapt to different devices and screen sizes.

### 3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It was originally developed to run in web browsers, allowing developers to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and communicate asynchronously with servers using AJAX. JavaScript is versatile, supporting both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It has evolved significantly with the introduction of ECMAScript standards, enhancing capabilities such as modern syntax features, modules, and asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await. JavaScript is now widely used not only for web development but also for server-side development (Node.js), mobile app development, and even desktop applications.
